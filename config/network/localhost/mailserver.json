I hope it's the latter.  (Note: if it's not the latter, there's a cognitohazard embedded in this message for you GOC motherfuckers, think about what you've done whilst your brain forgets how to breath.) If you've read this far, Congrats!  This message was meant for you.  So, tough break. I'm probably dead.  Unfortunate, but not an unknown. There's some more information about this computer in the next message, I'd recommend reading it.  After that, read the final message.  Sorry about this.  - Jack"

Anyway, all you need to know is this baby is capable of connecting to any computer system in the world, regardless of airgapping or conventional security measures.  Weirdly, it still required credentials once you get in, but comparatively, that's the easy part.  In the event of my demise or sudden mysterious disappearance, I leave this unit to Remy.  Consider it payment for the Macbook.  Use it wisely."
